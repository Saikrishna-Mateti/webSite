        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ <br />
          Iâ€™m Sai Krishna Mateti â€” a recent Electrical and Computer Engineering
          graduateðŸŽ“ from UAB, proud to finish with a 3.91 GPA. I'm currently
          working as a Software Engineer Intern at BearCreek AI, where I build
          clean, responsive frontend components that bring ideas to life, and
          develop new features in LLm agents to provide the best experience for
          users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve explored a range of topics, from
          building LLM agents and crafting engaging UIs to delving into data
          scienceâ€”cleaning raw data, performing analysis, training machine
          learning models, and even building neural networks from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          Now, Iâ€™m actively looking for full-time opportunities where I can
          contribute to meaningful projects in AI, software engineering, or data
          science. Iâ€™m passionate about building products that solve real
          problemsâ€”and learning something new every step of the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me on a badminton court with
          friends (great way to unwind!) or doing yoga to stay balanced and
          energized.
        </p>

        <p>Letâ€™s connect and build something great!</p>
